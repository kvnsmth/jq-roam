# jq-roam
This was an experiment in using jq to filter and do something useful (like hook into a static site) with Roam export JSON. I got this as far as being useful for my purposes so perhaps it can be useful for others.

## Tests

The tests require [shUnit2](https://github.com/kward/shunit2) to run. A quick and easy way on macOS to watch the tests [file](tests/all.sh) is to use watch (`brew install watch`).
